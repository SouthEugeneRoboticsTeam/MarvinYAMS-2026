    Big thing I realized is that in order to use telemetry easily for motors, you just have
to use the MechanismTelemetry class. You put in the subsystem name and the motor, for each motor.
e.g:

object ExampleSubsystem : SubsystemBase() {
    ...

    // This can be anywhere before the init{} block
    private val telemetry = MechanismTelemetry()

    ...

    init {
        telemetry.setupTelemetry("SubsystemName", motorOneSMC)
        telemetry.setupTelemetry("SubsystemName", motorTwoSMC)
    }

    ...

}


    This would be a REPLACEMENT for the telemetry stuff that's already in the FlywheelSubsystem init{}
block (excluding the default command). The same method can be used for the indexer and the intake when
those subsystems start being programmed (use this for anything WITHOUT a smart mechanism).
